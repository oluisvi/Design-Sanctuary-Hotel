Sanctuary hotel template design made for improvement using UX, color palettes and fonts to generate harmony.
The goal was to make a Website of a old hotel, so I used CMU Serif font style to give a old aspect, making it look like the hotel exists for a long time. 
The color palette used was based on the background.

The first page is the landing page, presenting the hotel with it's name and an attractive subtitle with 
mountain views on the back to represent the place that the hotel is located on.

# Design-Sanctuary-Hotel

Sanctuary hotel template design made for improvement using UX, color palettes and fonts to generate harmony.
The goal was to make a Website of a old hotel, so I used CMU Serif font style to give a old aspect, making it look like the hotel exists for a long time. 
The color palette used was based on the background, looking visually harmonic.
